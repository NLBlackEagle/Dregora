#

# This needs to be set to true to spawn the object in the Tree and Sapling resources.
Tree: false

# The frequency of the BO3 from 1 to 200. Tries this many times to spawn this BO3 when using the CustomObject(...) resource.

Frequency: 10

# The rarity of the BO3 from 0 to 100. Each spawn attempt has rarity% chance to succeed when using the CustomObject(...) resource.

Rarity: 30.0

# If you set this to true, the BO3 will be placed with a random rotation.
RotateRandomly: true

# The spawn height of the BO3 - atMinY, randomY, highestBlock or highestSolidBlock.
SpawnHeight: highestSolidBlock

# The offset from the spawn height to spawn this BO3
# Ex. SpawnHeight = highestSolidBlock, SpawnHeightOffset = 3; This object will spawn 3 blocks above the highest solid block
SpawnHeightOffset: 0

# A random amount to offset the spawn location from the spawn offset height
# Ex. SpawnHeightOffset = 3, SpawnHeightVariance = 3; This object will spawn 3 to 6 blocks above the original spot it would have spawned
SpawnHeightVariance: 0


# Height Limits for the BO3. #


# When in randomY mode used as the minimum Y or in atMinY mode as the actual Y to spawn this BO3 at.
MinHeight: 0

# When in randomY mode used as the maximum Y to spawn this BO3 at.
# NOTE: This value will be silently corrected to minHeight + 1 if it is equal or less!
MaxHeight: 256


# Extrusion settings #


# The style of extrusion you wish to use - BottomDown, TopUp, None (Default)
ExtrudeMode: None

# The blocks to extrude your BO3 through
ExtrudeThroughBlocks: AIR

# Objects can have other objects attacthed to it: branches. Branches can also
# have branches attached to it, which can also have branches, etc. This is the
# maximum branch depth for this objects.
MaxBranchDepth: 10

# When spawned with the UseWorld keyword, this BO3 should NOT spawn in the following biomes.
# If you writer.write the BO3 name directly in the BiomeConfigs, this will be ignored.

# +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ #
#

# Require a condition at a certain location in order for the BO3 to be spawned.
# BlockCheck(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - one of the blocks must be at the location
# BlockCheckNot(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - all the blocks must not be at the location
# LightCheck(x,y,z,minLightLevel,maxLightLevel) - light must be between min and max (inclusive)

# You can use "Solid" as a BlockName for matching all solid blocks or "All" to match all blocks that aren't air.

# Examples:
BlockCheck(0,1,0,STONE)
BlockCheck(0,0,0,STONE)
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,GRASS,DIRT)  Require grass or dirt just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,Solid)       Require any solid block just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL)        Require any type of wool just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL:0)      Require white wool just below the object
#   BlockCheckNot(0,-1,0,WOOL:0)   Require that there is no white wool below the object
#   LightCheck(0,0,0,0,1)          Require almost complete darkness just below the object

# +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ #
#

# Branches are objects that will spawn when this object spawns when it is used in
# the CustomStructure resource. Branches can also have branches, making complex
# structures possible. See the wiki for more details.

# Regular Branches spawn each branch with an independent chance of spawning.
# Branch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][IndividualChance])
# branchName - name of the object to spawn.
# rotation - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
# IndividualChance - The chance each branch has to spawn, assumed to be 100 when left blank

# Weighted Branches spawn branches with a dependent chance of spawning.
# WeightedBranch(x,y,z,branchName,rotation,chance[,anotherBranchName,rotation,chance[,...]][MaxChanceOutOf])
# MaxChanceOutOf - The chance all branches have to spawn out of, assumed to be 100 when left blank
