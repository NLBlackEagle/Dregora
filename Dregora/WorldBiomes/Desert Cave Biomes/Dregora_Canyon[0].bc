# Object:         can be a any kind of custom object (bo2 or bo3) but without the file extension. You can

# Plant and Grass resource: both a resource of one block. Plant can place blocks underground, Grass cannot.
# Liquid resource: a one-block water or lava source
# SmallLake and UnderGroundLake resources: small lakes of about 8x8 blocks
# Vein resource: not in vanilla. Starts an area where ores will spawn. Can be slow, so use a low Rarity (smaller than 1).
# CustomStructure resource: starts a BO3 structure in the chunk.

# of the vanilla trees. Add one or more Sapling functions here to override vanilla
# spawning for that sapling.

# The syntax is: Sapling(SaplingType,TreeType,TreeType_Chance[,Additional_TreeType,Additional_TreeType_Chance.....])
# Works like Tree resource instead first parameter.

# Sapling types: All, Oak, Redwood, Birch, SmallJungle, BigJungle, RedMushroom, BrownMushroom, Acacia, DarkOak, HugeRedwood
# All - will make the tree spawn from all saplings, but not from mushrooms.
# BigJungle - for when 4 jungle saplings grow at once.
# RedMushroom/BrownMushroom - will only grow when bonemeal is used.



# For virtual (replaceToBiomeName) biomes: Inherit all Sapling() resources from the
# replaceToBiomeName biome. If a Sapling() with the same SaplingType is defined 
# in this config and the parent config, the one from this config is used.

# This is where you configure mob spawning. Mobs spawn in groups,
# see http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Spawn#Mob_spawning

# A mobgroups is made of four parts. They are mob, weight, min and max.
# The mob is one of the Minecraft internal mob names.
# See http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format#Mobs
# The weight is used for a random selection. This is a positive integer.
# The min is the minimum amount of mobs spawning as a group. This is a positive integer.
# The max is the maximum amount of mobs spawning as a group. This is a positive integer.

# Mob groups are written to the config files in Json.
# Json is a tree document format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
# Write a mobgroup like this: {"mob": "mobname", "weight": integer, "min": integer, "max": integer}
# For example: {"mob": "Ocelot", "weight": 10, "min": 2, "max": 6}
# For example: {"mob": "MushroomCow", "weight": 5, "min": 2, "max": 2}
# A json list of mobgroups looks like this: [mobgroup, mobgroup, mobgroup...]
# This would be an ampty list: []
# You can validate your json here: http://jsonlint.com/

# There are four categories of mobs: monsters, creatures, water creatures and ambient creatures.
# In custom biomes, you can add your own mobgroups in the lists below. In the vanilla biomes,
# your changes are ignored.

# The monsters (skeletons, zombies, etc.) that spawn in this biome
# For instance [{"mob": "Spider", "weight": 100, "min": 4, "max": 4}, {"mob": "Zombie", "weight": 100, "min": 4, "max": 4}]
# Use the "/otg entities" console command to get a list of possible mobs and mob types.
# Use the "/otg biome -m" console command to get the list of registered mobs for a biome.
SpawnMonsters: []

# The friendly creatures (cows, pigs, etc.) that spawn in this biome
# For instance [{"mob": "Sheep", "weight": 12, "min": 4, "max": 4}, {"mob": "Pig", "weight": 10, "min": 4, "max": 4}]
# Use the "/otg entities" console command to get a list of possible mobs and mob types.
# Use the "/otg biome -m" console command to get the list of registered mobs for a biome.
SpawnCreatures: []

# The water creatures (only squids in vanilla) that spawn in this biome
# For instance [{"mob": "Squid", "weight": 10, "min": 4, "max": 4}]
# Use the "/otg entities" console command to get a list of possible mobs and mob types.
# Use the "/otg biome -m" console command to get the list of registered mobs for a biome.
SpawnWaterCreatures: []

# The ambient creatures (only bats in vanila) that spawn in this biome
# For instance [{"mob": "Bat", "weight": 10, "min": 8, "max": 8}]
# Use the "/otg entities" console command to get a list of possible mobs and mob types.
# Use the "/otg biome -m" console command to get the list of registered mobs for a biome.

# Forge Biome Dictionary ID used by other mods to identify a biome and place
# modded blocks, items and mobs in it.
# This will only work for modded items/blocks/mobs that are placed in biomes
# while chunks are being generated. Most mods that add mods add their mobs to
# biomes' internal mob list when MC starts and let MC's mob spawning mechanics
# handle the actual spawning. This means that when TC creates new biomes
# when it generates a world other mods do not add their mobs to those biomes.
# This can be solved by using the InheritMobsBiomeName setting to inherit a
# a mob list from a vanilla biome.
# NOTE: Only works for biomes with id's under < 255 (non-virtual biomes).
# For virtual biomes the BiomeDictId is inherited via ReplaceToBiomeName.
BiomeDictId: Overworld 

# Inherit the internal mobs list of another biome. Inherited mobs can be 
# overridden using the SpawnMonsters, SpawnCreatures, SpawnWaterCreatures
# and SpawnAmbientCreatures settings. Any mob type defined using those settings
# will override inherited mob settings for the same mob.
# Use this setting to inherit modded mobs from vanilla biomes (see also: BiomeDictId)
