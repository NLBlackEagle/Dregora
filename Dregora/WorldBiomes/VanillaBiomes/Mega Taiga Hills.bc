# The weight is used for a random selection. This is a positive integer.
# The min is the minimum amount of mobs spawning as a group. This is a positive integer.
# The max is the maximum amount of mobs spawning as a group. This is a positive integer.

# Mob groups are written to the config files in Json.
# Json is a tree document format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

# This will only work for modded items/blocks/mobs that are placed in biomes
# while chunks are being generated. Most mods that add mods add their mobs to
# biomes' internal mob list when MC starts and let MC's mob spawning mechanics
# handle the actual spawning. This means that when TC creates new biomes
# when it generates a world other mods do not add their mobs to those biomes.
# This can be solved by using the InheritMobsBiomeName setting to inherit a
# a mob list from a vanilla biome.
# NOTE: Only works for biomes with id's under < 255 (non-virtual biomes).
# For virtual biomes the BiomeDictId is inherited via ReplaceToBiomeName.
BiomeDictId: COLD, CONIFEROUS, FOREST, HILLS

# Inherit the internal mobs list of another biome. Inherited mobs can be 
# overridden using the SpawnMonsters, SpawnCreatures, SpawnWaterCreatures
# and SpawnAmbientCreatures settings. Any mob type defined using those settings
# will override inherited mob settings for the same mob.
# Use this setting to inherit modded mobs from vanilla biomes (see also: BiomeDictId)
InheritMobsBiomeName: Mega Taiga Hills
