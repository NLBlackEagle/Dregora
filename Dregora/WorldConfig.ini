# A short description of this world
Description: This world has been created by team Dregora. Find us on https://www.dregora.com for more info & content.

# What OpenTerrainGenerator does with the config files.
# Possible modes:
#    WriteAll - default
#    WriteWithoutComments - write config files without help comments
#    WriteDisable - doesn't write to the config files, it only reads. Doesn't auto-update the configs. Use with care!
SettingsMode: WriteAll

# Possible terrain modes:
#    Normal - use all features
#    TerrainTest - generate only terrain without any resources
#    NotGenerate - generate empty chunks
#    Default - use default terrain generator
#    OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3-like land generator
TerrainMode: Normal

# Possible biome modes:
#    Normal - use all features
#    FromImage - get biomes from image file
#    Default - use default Notch biome generator
# For old maps two more modes are available:
#    BeforeGroups - Minecraft 1.0 - 1.6.4 biome generator, only supports the biome groups NormalBiomes and IceBiomes
#    OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 biome generator

# You need to register your custom biomes here. This setting will make Open Terrain Generator
# generate setting files for them. However, it won't place them in the world automatically.
# See the settings for your BiomeMode below on how to add them to the world.

# Syntax: CustomBiomes:BiomeName:id[,AnotherBiomeName:id[,...]]
# Example: CustomBiomes:TestBiome1:30,BiomeTest2:31
# This will add two biomes and generate the BiomeConfigs for them.
# All changes here need a server restart.

# Due to the way Mojang's loading code works, all biome ids need to be unique
# on the server. If you don't do this, the client will display the biomes just fine,
# but the server can think it is another biome with the same id. This will cause saplings,
# snowfall and mobs to work as in the other biome.

# The available ids range from 0 to 1023 and the ids 0-39 and 127-167 are taken by vanilla.
# The ids 256-1023 cannot be saved to the map files, so use ReplaceToBiomeName in that biome.
# The Cartographer feature for Forge uses biome id 888.
